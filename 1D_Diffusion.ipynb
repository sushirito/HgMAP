        "Marine mercury contamination poses a severe threat to ecosystems and human health—estimates project \\$19 trillion in global health costs by 2050 due to anthropogenic emissions and climate-driven releases. In aquatic environments, inorganic Hg²⁺ undergoes microbial methylation, producing methylmercury (MeHg) that biomagnifies up the food chain. Monitoring and predicting mercury transport is extremely challenging. On the numerical side, classical techniques like finite differences or finite elements require fine meshes and can become prohibitively expensive for long-term, high-resolution forecasts—especially when boundary layer effects and steep concentration gradients arise due to mixed boundary conditions.\n",
